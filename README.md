# HotelReservation
This program models a hotel reservation system that books hotel rooms for customers. Customers want rooms with different number of beds. In the hotel, we have 100 rooms with only one bed, 50 rooms with 2 beds and 30 rooms with 3 beds. If the best available room has more beds than what customer asked for, we assign that room to the customer. But switching the room when itâ€™s assigned is not allowed. If the number of beds requested by customer is more than the biggest number of beds in all rooms, the program accommodates the customer with more than one room.
